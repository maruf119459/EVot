# **eVOt – Secure Electronic Voting System**  
*A Cryptography-Enhanced eVoting Platform Using One-Time Pad (OTP) Encryption*

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

**eVOt** is a secure and modern electronic voting system designed to replace traditional paper-based voting with a faster, safer, and more reliable digital solution. The system ensures strong protection of admin credentials through **One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption**, preventing unauthorized access and enhancing overall system security.

The platform provides a simple, user-friendly interface for voters, allowing them to cast their votes easily. Meanwhile, automated vote counting ensures accuracy, eliminates human error, and maintains transparency throughout the entire process.

eVOt integrates cryptographic techniques, secure database handling, and structured workflows to deliver a trustworthy digital voting environment.
